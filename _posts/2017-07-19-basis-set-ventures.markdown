In May 2017, I began talking with [Lan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuezhao-lan-50aa1a1/) from [Basis Set Ventures](https://basisset.ventures/) about branding her new $136M AI-focused venture capital fund.

We discussed the meaning of the name she chose and what Lan wanted her brand to communicate.

"[Basis Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra))" is a mathematical term from which Lan extracted a few key ideas: vectors and building blocks. She wanted her logo to reflect her straightforward and direct cadence, while also representing the modern, new school of venture capital.

I sketched and mocked up a set of divergent concepts to review for a sense of direction.

Lan liked the "Vector Block" (01) and "Vector b" (03) concepts, so we explored those further. Eventually, we decided that the Vector Block direction was strongest and began building out the brand from that core idea.

The Vector Block builds on Lan's core mathematical visuals to portray momentum and direction:

> Combination of building blocks and vectors from a basis set, together forming a vector space. Icon suggests employing fundamental elements to create upward momentum and improvement. Balanced and straightforward yet dynamic and driving.

After deciding on a direction, I created some variants of the logo to narrow in on a final design treatment. We played with specific visual characteristics such as weight and typography.

Over a few iterations, we chose a sharp and geometric form paired with Trade Gothic Pro typography.

At this stage, [Kurt Varner](https://twitter.com/kurtvarner) joined the project, as he would be serving as a design advisor to Basis Set. Kurt suggested bringing a "more vibrant, rich expression" to the brand.

After we explored solid color options, Kurt introduced a striking gradient and we built out a full pallete of bold colors.

The gradient's midpoint serves as the primary BSV purple, which will be used for solid color applications such as printing.

Once everything was locked, I productionized the assets by polishing up dimensions and finalizing lockup layouts.

A few social icon exports and slide deck templates later, and we had shipped the final brand for Basis Set Ventures!

I love how this project turned out, and it was a pleasure working with Lan and Kurt. Best of luck to the fund and portfolio companies in the future!
