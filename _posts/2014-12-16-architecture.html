<p>In UMD's Architecture Technology course, I created a series of projects that explored the use of software to augment the design process. Models were built with Rhinoceros, Revit, and SketchUp, parametrically modeled with Grasshopper, rendered with V-Ray and 3ds Max, comped with Photoshop, and finally presented with Illustrator and InDesign.</p>
